I started off life my life as a BBC Radio outside broadcast vehicle in the year
2000. I was sold in 2013 and came to belong to a Hospital Radio station where I
was still used as an outside broadcast vehicle.

In 2022 I was bought by a handful of Amateur Radio users who intend to use me to
talk to the world. They formed Mastcar Amateur Radio Club, and I now have the
callsign G1CAR.
